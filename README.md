He told the boy, “The nails were your bad temper and they were hammered on people.
You can remove the nails but the holes in the fence will remain. The fence will never look the same.
It has scars all over. Some nails cannot even be pulled out.

Use them to grow relationships.
Use them to show the love and kindness in your heart!”
