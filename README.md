# hello-world’ve seen an ad for this watch for kids and it looks really neat! I think David would be able to really utilize it and follow the commands, but Luke may be a little too young for it. I’m keeping it pinned on Pinterest so I can refer back to it around Christmastime!

I shared some of my favorite fall staples on the blog last week!

I love a slip on sneaker in the fall and winter, these look like great simple options at a great price!

I wrote a post reflecting on some things I learned this past summer. I tried to think of things that affected me/changed me as a person instead of only as a wife and mother. Both of the latter things are such a wonderful and huge part of me but I think it’s also important not to lose sight of what makes you tick as a person.
